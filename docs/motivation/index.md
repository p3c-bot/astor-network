# The History of Astor Testnet

Let's start with the motivation behind the Astor SHA3 Testnet.

**In early January 2019, Ethereum Classic was [51% attacked](https://medium.com/@slowmist/the-analysis-of-etc-51-attack-from-slowmist-team-728596d76ead) twice.**
- Attackers were able to acquire 51+% of the Ethash power on the network.
- They used this to reverse a series of deposits that they had made on exchanges.
- Many users throughout the ecosystem tried to mine ETC to protect it, but were unable to respond quickly enough to prevent the attack.

**A few days after the attack, [ECIP-1049](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/issues/13) was proposed. Its goal was to change ETC's proof of work algorithm to something safer, which more community members could fairly mine. That algorithm is SHA3 (also called Keccak256).**

There were three main reasons behind the proposal: 

**Strength.** SHA3 is the current gold standard in terms of hashing algorithms, and it is widely used in high performance and scientfic applications to safely and efficeintly hash data. It was the product of decades of research by the Keccak team, and was the winner of NIST SHA3 competition. ECIP-1049 also recognizes the need for ETC to diversify away from the same hashing algorithm as Ethereum.

**Transparency.** The SHA3 algorithm has been throughly peer-reviewed and its implementation verfied. With SHA3, block producers around the world have an even platform to competetitvely mine without having to worry about one team having an advantage over another. The 0xBitcoin community had been using SHA3 for over a year and has proven its viability as proof of work algorithm.

**Realism.** The 51% attack revealed something important, that ETC was a minority chain and could be attacked at any moment. Because of this exchanges started requiring thousands of block confirmations to mitigate the risk. By switching to a new algorithm, that was both powerful and unused, ETC could achieve majority hashpower and protect itself.

## Team

In May 2019, Alex, and Mike decided to collaborate on implementing ECIP-1049 over the 36 hour ETH NY hackathon. This site and code is a product of that collaboration.
